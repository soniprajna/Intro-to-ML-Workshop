# Intro-to-ML-Workshop

Workshop materials for a high school Introduction to Machine Learning workshop, demystifying "AI" and "ML".
The workshop can be run on [Kaggle](www.kaggle.com), [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/) or locally using a Jupyter Notebook supported environment and an editor like VSCode.

**For Kaggle**: 

Participants can create Kaggle accounts and access the .ipynb notebook and .csv data files from [my page](https://www.kaggle.com/prajnasoni/intro-to-ml) and copy them to their own accounts. After copying, they can edit and follow the workshop using their copies. 

**For Jupyter Hub**: 

Participants can use the [JupyterHub demo](https://jupyter.org/try) online and upload the files available on my [GitHub](https://github.com/soniprajna/Intro-to-ML-Workshop/). After uploading the files, participants can follow the workshop. Make sure that data files are uploaded to the same root folder.

**For VSCode**: 

Participants need to ensure that they have Jupyter and the relevant libraries installed. 
1. Install Python, pip, VSCode and the python and jupyter hub extension for VSCode
2. Install missing python libraries using pip: numpy, matplotlib, math, scikit-learn, and pandas
3. Open the folder where the data is stored and open the .ipynb file 
4. Participants can follow the workshop
